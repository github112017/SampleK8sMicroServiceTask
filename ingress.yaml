#
# Ingress resource for exposing the public service. 
#
# We leverage the path rewrite ability in Ngix to provide an abstraction from the 
# cloud services. We can expose any endpoints we want while maintaining the 
# flexibility to make changes on the cloud side. Also useful for support of multiple 
# versions of a service running concurrently
