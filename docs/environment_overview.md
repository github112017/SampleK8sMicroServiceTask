# Development Environment

Please take a minute to review the development environment I used to develop the project. 

If there are going to be any issues, they will likely be caused by an environment mismatch.

- The source code is Java 8 using the AdoptOpenJDK binaries.

- The Java framework is Spring Framework.

- The build framework is Gradle.

- The K8s environment is a Minikube installation on a macOS.
