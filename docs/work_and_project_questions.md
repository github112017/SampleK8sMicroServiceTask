It's your turn!  Now it is time to complete the project task as outlined in the original [doc](Kubernetes_Cluster_Micro-service_Task.pdf)

## Project Questions

When you're finished, please come back and answer the following questions.

### What ways can you have visibility into the services?


### How can you ensure the services are behaving as expected?


### If we require our services to scale, what modifications would you make to support horizontal scaling?
